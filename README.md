Notes
You should be able to checkout, run, and build all within IntelliJ Idea. Once you clone with git inside IntelliJ and
open the project, a run configuration should be added automatically; just push the play button to stat the app and
navigate to http://localhost:8080/quickAccessBookmark

If you have any questions about anything, feel free to ask.
